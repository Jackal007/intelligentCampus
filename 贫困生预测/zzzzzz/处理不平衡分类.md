"In Scikit learn there are some imbalance correction techniques, which vary according with which learning algorithm are you using.

Some one of them, like Svm or logistic regression, have the class_weight parameter. If you instantiate a SVC with this parameter set on 'auto', it will weight each class example proportionally to the inverse of its frequency.

Unfortunately, there isn't a preprocessor tool with this purpose."
